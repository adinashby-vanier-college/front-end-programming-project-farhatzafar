                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h5>Programmer</h5>
                <p>As a student in the Software Development program at Vanier College, I am exploring the constantly evolving
                     field of computer science. Throughout my studies, I have had the opportunity to learn several programming
                      languages, including Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Among these, Java has particularly captured my
                       interest. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of specializing as a Java developer in the future and am
                        eager to deepen my knowledge in this area. In addition to coding languages, I have gained valuable
                         experience working with Linux operating systems, particularly the Debian and CentOS distributions.
                          Looking ahead, I am excited to expand my technical skill set by studying more advanced programming
                           languages, such as C++, C#, and Python. I am also interested in exploring cloud computing platforms,
                            with a particular focus on Microsoft Azure.

                <h5>Biologist</h5>
                <p>I am a Master’s (MSc) graduate of the Applied Synthetic Biology (SynBioApps) program from the Center
                     for Applied Synthetic Biology (CASB) at Concordia University. My research focused on the cholesterol
                      biosynthesis pathway, specifically the human gene MVK (mevalonate kinase) and its yeast ortholog ERG12.
                       My goal was to create a system that could knockout the yeast gene and replace it with variants of
                        the human gene. This is known as a “humanization” study, in which human genes are engineered into
                         yeast. I succeeded in genetically engineering such a system and using it to perform complementation
                          assays. After completing my Master’s degree during the pandemic, I began a PhD that focused on
                           expanding on my previous research. During the first year of my PhD, I created a mutant library,
                            consisting of over 49 000 unique variants. The variants were tiled, indexed and sequenced using
                             next- generation Illumina sequencing.</p>
