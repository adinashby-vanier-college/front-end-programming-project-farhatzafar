                <h4 class="blogtitle">Bioinformatics: Where Programming and Biology Meet</h4>
                <p class="blogoverview">Bioinformatics is the field where computer science is applied to analyze 
                    biological data, playing a crucial role in areas like genetics research. Sequencing DNA, for
                     example, generates enormous volumes of data that cannot be processed manually. To tackle 
                     this, we rely on algorithms to manage and interpret the data efficiently. In my previous
                      research, I created a mutant library of a disease-associated gene, which included over
                       40,000 variants. Designing and sequencing this library would have been unfeasible without
                        the collaboration of a programmer. Now that I have gained programming skills myself, I
                         am eager to combine my expertise in both fields and further explore bioinformatics.

                <h4 class="blogtitle">Returning to studies</h4>
                <p class="blogoverview">I completed a Master's in Biology and began a PhD in the same field, 
                    where I deepened my understanding of biological research. However, I recognized that to
                     stay at the forefront of scientific innovation, I needed to expand my skill set. 
                     This led me to learn programming, with the aim of bridging the gap between biology
                      and technology. Acquiring programming skills has allowed me to approach biological
                       problems with a new perspective, enabling me to analyze complex data and develop more efficient solutions.
